# Constraint Physics

A field concerned with the formal limits of observation, measurement,
and claim under finite resolution.

Constraint Physics studies what can and cannot be stated about a system
when observation is bounded, instruments are fallible, and authority
is never assumed. It is not an optimizer, not a controller, and not
a prediction framework.
