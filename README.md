# Constraint Physics

A field concerned with the formal limits of observation, measurement,
and claim under finite resolution.

Constraint Physics studies what can and cannot be stated about a system
when observation is bounded, instruments are fallible, and authority
is never assumed. It is not an optimizer, not a controller, and not
a prediction framework.

## Posture

**CRL-0** — public declarative surface only.

## What this repository is

A front door. Navigation, orientation, community framing, and pointers
to the canonical record in `constraint-spine`.

Canonical standards and versioned doctrine live in `constraint-spine` (cite tags).
This repo is navigation only. It does not duplicate canon. It does not contain
methods, schemas, or operational guidance.
