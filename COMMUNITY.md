# Community

## Reading group framing

Constraint Physics is best engaged as a **jurisdictional reading exercise**:
what does this paper exclude, what claims does it permit, and where does
authority stop?

This is not a demonstrations community. There are no method workshops,
no implementation tutorials, no optimization benchmarks. The field is
concerned with limits, not recipes.

## How to read

Start with [Paper VI](https://github.com/C-Zenno/constraint-spine/blob/main/docs/reading-order.md).
Everything else inherits its exclusions. If a later paper appears to
contradict Paper VI, the exclusion wins.

The [Glossary](https://github.com/C-Zenno/constraint-spine/blob/main/docs/glossary.md)
is a controlled vocabulary — terms mean exactly what the glossary says,
not what adjacent fields may assume.

## What this community discusses

- Scope and boundary declarations
- Admissibility as a formal concept (not a metric)
- Claims, limits, receipts, and refusal
- Foundation notes and axiomatic vocabulary
- Governance events (changelog entries, tag rationale)

## What this community does not discuss

- Detection or estimation methods
- Threshold values or calibration procedures
- Operational deployment or integration patterns
- Optimization, scoring, or ranking
- Ethics debates or alignment guarantees

The field has a position on what can be stated under constraint.
It does not have a position on what should be done.
