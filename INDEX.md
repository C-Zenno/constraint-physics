# Field Index

Table of contents for Constraint Physics.
All entries point to canonical sources in
[constraint-spine](https://github.com/C-Zenno/constraint-spine).

## Program

The Constraint Program declares the scope, jurisdiction, and exclusions
that define this field. It is a boundary-first program: what is excluded
is stated before what is permitted.

→ [Spine Index](https://github.com/C-Zenno/constraint-spine/blob/main/docs/index.md)

## Papers

Seven papers form the declarative record. Reading begins with Paper VI
(the boundary paper); all subsequent papers inherit its exclusions.

→ [Reading Order](https://github.com/C-Zenno/constraint-spine/blob/main/docs/reading-order.md)

## Axioms & Foundation Notes

Foundation Notes (FN-0, FN-1, FN-2) establish axiomatic vocabulary
and interpretive boundaries. Reserved entries are catalog placeholders only.

→ [Foundation Notes](https://github.com/C-Zenno/constraint-spine/blob/main/docs/index.md#foundation-notes)

## Lexicon

Controlled vocabulary with IP-status markers. Definitions describe
what terms mean, not how to compute or detect anything.

→ [Glossary](https://github.com/C-Zenno/constraint-spine/blob/main/docs/glossary.md)

## Claim Rules & Signature Map

CRL-0 speech constraints and the recurring legibility map.

> [Claim Rules (CRL-0)](https://github.com/C-Zenno/constraint-spine/blob/main/docs/CLAIM_RULES.md)
> [Signature Map](https://github.com/C-Zenno/constraint-spine/blob/main/docs/SIGNATURE_MAP.md)

## Hierarchy

Claim-discipline ordering of primitives and dependent terms. Vocabulary, not derivation.

## Posture & Licenses

Two license stages govern what may be said at each surface:

- **CRL-0** — declarative only (public theory, no operations)
- **OEL-1** — observer-only evaluation (no directives, no authority)

→ [CRL-0](https://github.com/C-Zenno/constraint-spine/blob/main/docs/licenses/CRL-0.md)
→ [OEL-1](https://github.com/C-Zenno/constraint-spine/blob/main/docs/licenses/OEL-1.md)

## Change Log

All changes to the canon are governance events — reviewed, diffable,
version-tagged. The changelog and canon policy live in `constraint-spine`.

→ [Changelog](https://github.com/C-Zenno/constraint-spine/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
→ [Canon Policy](https://github.com/C-Zenno/constraint-spine/blob/main/CANON.md)

## Community
